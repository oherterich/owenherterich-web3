	<h2>Visualizing the Dialogue in Literature</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>For thousands of years, dialogue has been a powerful force in the world of writing. Socrates believed that truth lay within man's soul, and was to be called forth from that inner abode through the question and answer of dialogue. Although dialogue can be seen as a way to awake emotion in an audience, it also has a logical and constructive nature. It can be used as a way of seeing the overarching hierarchy and plot of a novel, as well as inform the reader of the lens in which the novel should be viewed.</p>
	<p>Pictured here are a multitude of different novels that span a wide range of time, genre, and intended audience. These visualizations form their own "fingerprints" for each novel: no two are alike.</p>
	<p>Each line in these visualizations is one line of dialogue in the book. These are mapped around an inner circle, the radius of which is determined by the length of the book: the bigger the circle, the longer the book. Accordingly, the more dense the visual representation, the higher proportion of dialogue that exists in that specific work of literature.</p>

	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>This project was created using <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>. The process was as follows:</p>
	<p>First, a plain text file for each book must be located. These can be found all over the Internet, but a great multitude exist on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.</p>
	<p>Next, these text files must be prepared. They are brought into a word processor, and a space is placed before and after each quotation mark ("). Then, the entire text file is brought together into one single (and extremely long) line of text.</p>
	<p>The modified text file is brought into processing, where the entire file is separated according to each quotation mark found. What was inside the sets of quotation marks (the dialogue) is then mapped around a circle.</p>
	<p>The code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/oherterich/ToSeeAndHear">GitHub</a>.</p>
